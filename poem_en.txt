In summer's clime we oft doth stand,
Where golden rays reflect on sand,
But winter's chill brings autumn's fall,
And all the leaves doth downward sprawl.
Yet love remains, a constant fire,
That in our hearts doth never tire.
For though the seasons come and go,
Love's eternal flame, it doth still glow.
